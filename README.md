# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts

## Introduction
The work that I've uploaded here forms part of the coursework for the Data Science track on Dataquest. It basically reinforces the topics learnt throughout the course and provides the opportunity to develop a methodology for data analysis and to begin developing a portfolio.

## Project Information
Hacker News was created by the startup incubator Y Combinator. Similar to reddit, user-submitted stories known as posts are voted and commented upon. In technology and startup circles, Hacker News is extremely popular and top posts can generate hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

The aim of this project is to analyze Hacker News posts to determine which type of posts are most popular and what is the best time to post to Hacker News.
